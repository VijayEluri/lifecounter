LifeCounter
-----------

LifeCounter is a small application for Android I made after getting my Android Dev Phone 1, as a small project to learn the platform and brush up on my Java.

There are two tags on this repository: master, which is the source code to the free version on Android Marketplace, and nonfree, which has identical code as master, but is in a different package because I can't just upload the same package name to the market. "nonfree" is in the name for legacy reasons; both versions are licensed under GPLv3+.

Download LifeCounter on the Android Market:

- [Free Edition][free]
- [$0.99 Donation Edition][donation]

Or you can [download LifeCounter.apk][apk] and manually install it.
